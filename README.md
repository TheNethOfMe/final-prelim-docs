# Prelim Docs for Final Project

Hey guys, in this folder, you'll be able to take a look at a few wire frames I created in GIMP. This is just a rough outline of what the pages could look like and how we could lay them out. I'm not married to any of the colors (in fact they're pretty random) or the title of the game. I just wanted to have something mocked up.
